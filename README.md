# Around The U.S.

  ### overview
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's tutors and personnel. They share some interesting information about the places they come from, share some of their culture, and pictures of their hometowns.

### Technologies

In this project, we implemented useful technologies such as flex-box, grid layout, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript with a BEM structure, NPM, and Webpack.

### Future plans

Our plan is to use this website as a blueprint for new websites, improve and scale the project for bigger needs.
